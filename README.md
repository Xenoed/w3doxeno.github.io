# URL Shortener

A free URL shortener service enabled by the NOSTR protocol, that is fast and fuss-free, stripped of all bells and whistles, no gimmicksâ€”it just works!

Visit [w3.do](https://w3.do), the URL shortener service enabled by the NOSTR protocol.

### Kind 1994

```
const id = nanoid(8);

const event = new NDKEvent();
event.kind = 1994;
event.tags = [
  ["d", id],
  ["r", '<user input>'],
];
```

Why 1994?

Because URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) were defined in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. [[source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki)]
